# Image Resizer

This is a simple image resizer that takes an image from the `input` directory, doubles its size, and saves the result as a PNG file in the `output` directory.

## Important

Note that this project has been created using Bun (because it just works). So the start script is "bun run index.ts" istead of "node ."

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `bun install`.
3. Add your image to the `input` directory.
4. Run the script by running `bun start`.
5. Check the `output` directory for the resized image.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- `fs`: File system module.
- `pngjs`: PNG image decoder and encoder.
